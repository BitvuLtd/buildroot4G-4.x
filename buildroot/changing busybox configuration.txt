BusyBox configuration
=====================
=====================

BusyBox has its own configuration file in .../buildroot/package/busybox/busybox.config

When using make 'busybox-mennuconfig' you have to actually load this specific busybox configuration file using 
the full path to the file, _before_ you start making any changes. (This is a pain. I create the full path in a separate document that I can the just cut and paste).

Now make any changes to busybox that you require.

When saving the changes you have to specifically set the full path to the busybox.config file again. 

Configuring which BusyBox configuration file to use in menuconfig
=================================================================
=================================================================

When using 'make menuconfig' check that 
Target packages
	-*- BusyBox
		(path to busybox configuraiton file. i.e. package/busybox/busybox.config)



There may be an easier way to do all this but I've not found it yet.
