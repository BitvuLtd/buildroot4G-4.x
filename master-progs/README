Now that this repository has two branches I can make a cleaner separation between the files
that realate to the Freedom/Spark and thoes that are specific to the 4G modem.

This directory is prefixed with 'master-' and is to contain code, binaries and scripts that 
will be useful for the Freedom and 4G code base.
