read-pin.sh		- Reads the value of the requested GPIO pin.
start-pls8.sh		- Brings the PLS8 up

sure			- This script is not strictly related to the modem. This is just a little script that checks all command line imput
			- and searches for block input devices that _must_ not be written to i.e. /dev/sda. It prints a message and exits 
			- if such a block device is located. 
			- Usage: [sudo] sure dd if=/dev/sdd of=/dev/sda
			-	In this case the /dev/sda would be over-written. 
			- The 'sure' command is completely passive. I wrote is for my own purposes.

up-pls8			- This script toggles the GPIO pin 36 to power on the modem. It waits for 20s for the appearance of the /dev/ttyACM* ports and
			- the set the modem's SSRVSET
urc-input.sh		- A work in progress 
write-pin.sh		- Write value to specific gpio pin.
