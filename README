A Little History.

The name of this repository, buildroot4G-4.x, is a result of historical incremental development. 

Initiallly is was not a GIT repository but a subdirectoty for development work on the Gemalto 4G
modem. Later it was enhanced by appending "-4.x" to the directory name to signify that the 
version of Linux being used was 4.x.

[Originally there was also a subdirectory to handle the building of the OS for the in-house board,
which was using Linux 3.18.14. This verison of Linux was not usable for some of the later Wi-Fi
chipsets and it was droped in favour of the single subdirectory buildroot4G-4.x, which now handles
the building of the 4.x based OS and modem development]

At this point there it was a collection of scripts realted to the in-house board (now called Freedom)
and the Freedom+Gemalto combination all mixed in together.

It became rather confusing to figure out what script was releted to which functionality so the code was
restructured to use GIT branches. (On hindsight this would not have been the only way of proceeding. 
Creating appropriately named sub-directories could have been made to work as well)

This reprository has two branches:
master
modem


The master branch is were you should start. In the buildroot directory there are two
important configuration files.

.config
.bitvu-kernel-config-220816

Both these file are versioned using Git. 

To build the base operating system (currently 4.4.8) enter
make on the command line when in the .buildroot subcirectory.
The .bitvu-kernel-config-220816 is the kernel configutaion file i.e specifies which kernel
modules are included etc (this is the saved output from "make linux-memnuconfig")

Read the file ./buildroot/CreateSDcard.md to understand the steps involved in creating a bootable SD card.

The 'modem' branch restricts itself to scripts and binaries that are related to the 
operation of the Gemalto PLS8-E modem.
