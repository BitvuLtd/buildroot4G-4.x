Manifest file :

dd-production-sdcard.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This script is to be used in conjuction with an sd card that has already been formatted 
using the mk-production-sdcard.sh scripti (it won't work with any old sd card). 
It reads the sd card and produces an output 'img' file of the sd card. 

Example use: dd-production-sdcard.sh /dev/sd[x] my-sdcard.img

The 'img' file produced is of a fixed size.

You can copy the produced 'img' file to another sd card using the command [sudo] dd if=<img file> of=/dev/sd[x]

mk-production-sdcard.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run this script to create a 'production' formatted sd card. The sd card should be 8GB. It does not have 
to be pre-formatted. Any exising data on the sd card will be deleted.

Example usage: [sudo] mk-production-sdcard.sh /dev/sd[x]


If you want to examine the formatted card use the following command.

sudo parted -s unit mib print free /dev/sd[x]

The output should be:

Disk /dev/sdx: 7420MiB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B

S021upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the /etc/init.d script that checks the /mnt/upgrade file system for any 'package.zip' 
file. Read the contents of the file to understand the upgrade process.

The package.zip file has to contain an 'install' bash script and any other necessary files
that the install script will operate on.

The package.zip is created externally and downloaded to the /mnt/upgrade file system root.
On next reboot the /etc/init.d/S021upgrade script will operate on the package.zip file.

At the end of the operation the package.zip file is deleted.

fs-install-template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example of an 'install' script. It will install a shadow root file system 
into /mnt/shadow-rootfsi and modify the cmdline.txt file (on /mnt/boot). 

The root file system to install would be included in the externally produced package.zip downloaded file.
